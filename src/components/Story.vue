                            <p>Picture this: a 13-year-old girl enthusiastically typing away at the keyboard back when the internet was so new most people were still connecting through their phone lines. While the rest of the class was still busy with their computer assignments, I had already finished and was building my first HTML webpage instead. I absolutely loved it and couldn't wait to get home, download Photoshop to create pretty things, and start building my very first website.</p>

                            <p>Fast forward 17 years and I'm successfully making a living doing what I love. After getting my Bachelor of ICT, I started working as a designer and front-end developer at BasisOnline, revolutionising primary education with websites and apps. While my creativity, designer's eye and experience in UI/UX design is an asset in every project, I'm focussing on the development part of the front-end now, helping Langdon Systems build their new duty management application.</p>
